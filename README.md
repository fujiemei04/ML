# ML
Personal mini-projects made to apply the concepts learned from python and data science subjects, data analysis and modelling with big amounts of data.
Among the libraries used are sklearn for logistic and linear regression, RF algorithm... and tensorflow for building NN. Panda for data analysis 
and manipulation, seaborn and matplot lib for visualization...
